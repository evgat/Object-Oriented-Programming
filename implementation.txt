Implementation:

First it asks us to put the email. We put one of the following: mail1, mail2, mail3, mail4, mail5, mail6, mail7, mail8

This will show us the main menu.

To send a message to a friend in the main menu press option 2. Then it will show us the list of
the friends of the logged in user. We select a user by simply typing the number as shown in the menu.

When we select the appropriate user it shows us the messages that the user has on his wall as well as 3 options.
The options are 1. to post on the user's friend's wall, 2. to send a reply to a message (not implemented) and to like a message.

In case we press 1 It shows us a message and prompts us to enter the message we want to be published on the wall.
If we now press 3, the program will prompt us to enter the number of the message to like.


To send a friend request in the main menu press option 3. Then a list of users will appear
who are not friends of the connected user and will ask us to choose one of them. After we choose to send the message.

To accept or reject a friend request press option 4. When this is done we will see a list of all requests
which we have received and not answered. To answer one, type the corresponding number.
Then the program
it will ask us if we want to accept the request. The options are yes/no.

Back option (6) is not implemented.

Disconnect: To disconnect the user and connect to another in the main menu, press option 7. In this way, he will ask us for a new email.
We put one of the available ones. (mail1, mail2, mail3, mail4, mail5, mail6, mail7, mail8, mail9, mail10).
